    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>My name is Alina Hyk and I prefer to be called Alina.</p>
    
    <h2>OSU Email Address</h2>
    <p>hyka@oregonstate.edu</p>
    
    <h2>Major and Year of Study</h2>
    <p>I'm a senior and I'm majoring in Computer Science and Psychology</p>
    
    <h2>Web Development Experience</h2>
    <p>I didn't do much with web dev. I had to do some relatively simple UI and UX designs for the AI tools I have been developing in the past, and for those I usually used CSS. There wasn't something that I can point out, just will note that entire Web Dev is a bit confusing to me, although it reminds me of LaTeX which actually helps me grasp it better.</p>
    
    <h2>What I Hope to Learn</h2>
    <p>The center focus for me is to learn how to create various UI interfaces relatively easy and efficiently. That's main focus skills wise. In addition to that however, I would love to get a chance to get started and learn all that I need to do a good portfolio person website because that's something that I really need for my resume and portfolio and more general media appearance.</p>
    
    <h2>Ed Forum Post</h2>
    <p>Yes, I did read the "Is there a particular reason we need a clear photo of our face for the assignment? Could we use a photo of something else?" thread.</p>
    
    <h2>Interesting Fact</h2>
    <p>I can memorize 100 random words and recall them in the order in which they were given in under 10 minutes.</p>
