        <h2>HW 1</h2>
        <p><em>October 16, 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>I did not face any significant troubles with this assignment. I was however at the research conference with overlapping amount of work, so accomplishing anything at all was challenging, including this assignment, just due to time constraints, but there is no fault of the assignment itself in it.</p>
        
        <p>I did not know how to include photos, so I mostly learned that. I also wasn't sure how to deal with link in one page that led to another, which this assignment also helped sort out.</p>
        
        <p>Just googling and asking in Claude 4.5 if I did my photos pasting correctly. ED discussion was more helpful for general questions about assignments (such as requirement of photos inclusion), not exactly with technical challenges.</p>

        <h2>HW 2</h2>
        <p><em>October 29, 2025</em></p>
         <p> The major challenge for me was just making sure that I got all details correctly, such as colors and fonts — the overall structure was clear for me, and I was able to get the skeleton done pretty quickly and then just work through it to finish the consistency, but then I spent about an hour ensuring alignment with the mockups as properly as I could.</p>
         <p>I also had one specific challenge that I described and addressed in the comment to the code directly: I wasn’t sure how to make it such that at any given time at most three items are shown in one row (since that is how it appeared on the mocks) with re-sizing working too. But I was able to eventually make it work, consulting some online resources.</p>
        
        <p>I learned a lot of new things actually! I used CSS before, but I never quite grasped how the alignment between HTML and CSS worked, so this assignment was a really good practice for that. It was also SUPER helpful working with mocks — I feel like this is an important experience to have for future career, and somehow I never did it before, so yeah, super helpful. Thank you!</p>

        <p>Just googling mostly and looking at the lecture notes.</p>

        <h2>HW 3</h2>
        <p><em>November 12, 2025</em></p>
        <p> The major challenge for me was a time constraint. I was very busy for the week prior to the assignment and didn’t have time to start working on it earlier, so I was really on a time crunch. Being able to rewatch recorded lectures and Google/consult Claude 4.5 or any documentation and confirming that the solutions I had were good enough was helpful, but still I wish I had more time. Nonetheless, I think I did well overall and I’m confident in my approach. I will, however, spend a little bit more time even after the assignment’s review on some specific issues and details to ensure that I can pass some points without being in the rush. </p>
        <p> That was a first time for me using JavaScript, so that was the main learning component I would say. Also, to the lesser extent, just reminding myself of how to test your work was good; it’s been a while since I had to do something like a “unit test,” but although to a small scale it was nice practicing it due to this assignment. </p>
        <p> Rewatching lecture notes, asking classmates for their understanding on parts of lecture that I was somewhat confused about, and just kind of brainstorming the application with them. Also, varying my questioning and brainstorming parts on which I wanted confidence with Claude helped a lot. </p>
