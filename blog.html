        <p><em>October 16, 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>I did not face any significant troubles with this assignment. I was however at the research conference with overlapping amount of work, so accomplishing anything at all was challenging, including this assignment, just due to time constraints, but there is no fault of the assignment itself in it.</p>
        
        <p>I did not know how to include photos, so I mostly learned that. I also wasn't sure how to deal with link in one page that led to another, which this assignment also helped sort out.</p>
        
        <p>Just googling and asking in Claude 4.5 if I did my photos pasting correctly. ED discussion was more helpful for general questions about assignments (such as requirement of photos inclusion), not exactly with technical challenges.</p>

        <h2>HW 2</h2>
        <p><em>October 29, 2025</em></p>
         <p> The major challenge for me was just making sure that I got all details correctly, such as colors and fonts — the overall structure was clear for me, and I was able to get the skeleton done pretty quickly and then just work through it to finish the consistency, but then I spent about an hour ensuring alignment with the mockups as properly as I could.</p>
         <p>I also had one specific challenge that I described and addressed in the comment to the code directly: I wasn’t sure how to make it such that at any given time at most three items are shown in one row (since that is how it appeared on the mocks) with re-sizing working too. But I was able to eventually make it work, consulting some online resources.</p>
        
        <p>I learned a lot of new things actually! I used CSS before, but I never quite grasped how the alignment between HTML and CSS worked, so this assignment was a really good practice for that. It was also SUPER helpful working with mocks — I feel like this is an important experience to have for future career, and somehow I never did it before, so yeah, super helpful. Thank you!</p>

        <p>Just googling mostly and looking at the lecture notes.</p>
