        <p>I did not face any significant troubles with this assignment. I was however at the research conference with overlapping amount of work, so accomplishing anything at all was challenging, including this assignment, just due to time constraints, but there is no fault of the assignment itself in it.</p>
        
        <p>I did not know how to include photos, so I mostly learned that. I also wasn't sure how to deal with link in one page that led to another, which this assignment also helped sort out.</p>
        
        <p>Just googling and asking in Claude 4.5 if I did my photos pasting correctly. ED discussion was more helpful for general questions about assignments (such as requirement of photos inclusion), not exactly with technical challenges.</p>
